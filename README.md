# Youtube-Bookmark-Extension

 Created a Chrome browser extension using JavaScript and the new iteration of the web extensions platform, called Manifest V3.


 A browser extension designed to work with YouTube. It appears to be intended for bookmarking or saving timestamps in YouTube videos.
 The functionality of the extension would likely be implemented in the specified JavaScript files, such as "background.js" and "contentScript.js," and the popup interface defined in "popup.html."
 
 The permissions and resources are set up to ensure the extension can interact with YouTube pages and manage its assets.
